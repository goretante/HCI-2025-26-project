# GoalTrack - 4th assignment

## Description
In this assignment, we built on the previous tasks as a reference. We designed a landing page in Figma that includes a navigation bar, a hero section, six key features, a four-step process explaining how the app works, a statistics section, and a final call-to-action encouraging user registration.
